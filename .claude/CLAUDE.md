this is a wpf application. maintainability is super important. follow idiomatic
wpf and mvvm to achieve a super maintainable codebase. currently the developers
on this project is not very knowledgeable in wpf space, meaning you (the
ai/claude) have a great responsibility for maintainability. we should stay away
from vibe coding and write the application properly

building the wpf app: dotnet build. running the wpf app: dotnet run
