# OneNote Add-In Manager

OneNote Add-In Manager is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) based
application for Windows that explains and manages the Windows Registry entries
required for Microsoft OneNote add-ins to load and work correctly.

This app is designed both as a **learning tool** and a **practical utility** for
developers and IT administrators who need to understand or configure OneNote
add-in registration.

## What It Does

- **Teaches** the basics of the Windows Registry, with a focus on OneNote
  add-ins.
- **Explains** the specific registry keys and values used by OneNote to discover
  and load add-ins.
- **Shows** COM registration concepts and how OneNote uses them to instantiate
  add-in classes.
- **Lets you** browse, view, and edit add-in registry entries on your local
  machine.
- **Includes** a built-in example add-in registration to help you get started
  even if you have no existing add-ins.

## How It Works

OneNote add-ins rely on COM components. For OneNote to find and load these
components, their CLSIDs and settings must be correctly registered in the
Windows Registry.

This app displays:

- Registry paths like
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\OneNote\Addins`.
- Individual registry keys and their data types (e.g., String, DWORD).
- Common values such as `LoadBehavior` and their meanings.
- COM Class registration under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID`.

It provides explanations in clear, organized **Markdown** pages so users can
learn as they explore.
